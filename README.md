Exploratory data analysis (Hotels Price Analysis - Using OYO)
OYO is a hotel management and booking company that aims to provide affordable and standardized accommodation options to travelers. One way to analyze the prices of hotel on OYO would be to compare the prices of similar hotels in the same location . we could also compare the prices of hotels on OYO with the prices of hotels on other booking platforms or the prices listed on the hotel's own website.(https://github.com/Amarnathchoudhury/Hotels-Price-Analysis-EDA-/assets/130665477/8215dd8b-8650-4caf-97e2-1f831dd7d54d)

CHALLENGES FACED : 
Our project is based on Oyo website ,we need to scrap data from Oyo website . Once we  created DataFrame  after collecting data .If we restart the jupyter Notebook then length of the data will be vary for all columns for creating the Data Frame .
Because Oyo room can be booked at any time and again it will be normal at morning.

While cleaning a column named city. We have some empty space we need to replace that empty space with that particular city, but that space is not one  space ,it is more than some spaces.

We faced some problems in visualization , like deciding which plot suits for which columns
